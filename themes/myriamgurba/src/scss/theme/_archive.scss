from around 10 minute mark on how to write css for specific pages only

For example, if you wanted a READ MORE button to show larger on archive pages, you have two choices.
One option is to add a class to buttons on archive pages. 
The other is to add css to the .btn class that only applies on archive pages.
This latter approach seems cleaner than adding a bunch of new classes to overrite earlier classes.
